# copy2hash

## Copy or rename any file(s) to a *hash-secured* filename via terminal
---

`copy2hash` copies or renames file(s) with regular titles to file(s) with a *hash-secured* title by using the terminal or in `python`-framework. Having unique filenames is essential for the correct indexing of databases, especially if the data come from different pipelines. Also, it is important if the filename or/and directory contains *meta*-information, which extend the length of the valid file lengths. 




The copy or rename processed will be automatically logged as: 
 1. `*.csv`-file
 2. `*.json`-file
 3. `*.pkl`-file
 4. `*.txt`-file
 5. `*.yaml`-file
 6. `*.xml`-file
